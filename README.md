- If we have component that does not have props or stay changing you do not need to render it. You can just use the same output as before. 
-  ‘useCallback’ returns a memoized callback and ‘useMemo’ returns a memoized value that is the result of the function parameter.
- ‘useCallback’, however, is used differently. Take for example a parent component that often re-renders. Inside the parent, we have a child component that takes a function-prop. At each re-render, the Child will re-execute its function prop uselessly. However, if you pass ‘useCallback’ as a prop with a dependency array, it resolves the issue because the function will be executed only when the dependency changes. Every other re-render will then get a cached function.
-functional components cannot be given refs.
